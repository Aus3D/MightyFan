# MightyFan

MightyFan is a fan expansion board for the RAMPS 3D printer control board. It allows control of four additional fans through pins D4, D5, D6 and D11.

MightyFan is designed to be easy to install. It plugs directly into RAMPS - no soldering is required. A screw terminal allows for connection to 12/24V, so two short wires can be run from RAMPS power input screw terminals to the MightyFan board.
Standard .1" pin headers are used for fan connections.

MightyFan is open source, and licensed under the GPL V3. MightyFan was designed in Altium Designer, which may make it difficult for some to access - gerber files (for manufacturing) and PDF files (for schematic) have been included to attempt to address this.
